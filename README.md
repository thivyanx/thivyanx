### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m [**Thivyan**](), a Data Science undergraduate based in Sri Lanka.
I’m passionate about solving problems with data and building practical tech solutions that actually work in the real world. I enjoy keeping things simple, writing clean code, and continuously improving my skills.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- Python & SQL 
- Building responsive web projects

---

**Some stuff I built:**
- [Modern Responsive Website](https://thivyanx.github.io/modern-responsive-website/) – A fully responsive multi-section website with smooth scroll animations, interactive components, and custom UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [Flight Delay Prediction System]() – A machine learning model that predicts flight delays using  flight data.
